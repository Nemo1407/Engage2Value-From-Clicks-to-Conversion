The goal of this project is to predict a customer’s purchase value based on their multi-session behavior across digital engagement.
The dataset used for model training and testing purposes captures anonymized user interactions, including browser types, traffic sources, device details, and geographical indicators. 
After analyzing the data and completing data preprocessing, three machine learning models—XGBoost, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression — are used to train the data with hyperparameter tuning to detect patterns, which will estimate the purchase potential of each user, helping to optimize marketing and engagement strategies. 
R^2 score is used here to evaluate each model's performance.
